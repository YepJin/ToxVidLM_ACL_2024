A couple people asked for a review. This is pretty much my review. I like it enough to tell you about it. You are not going to take it on like a hike or off-roading. This is really like around the neighborhood. And I think it's fun. Number one question statement was, I need one. You can get one by clicking the LTK link, but I'm not a big link pusher. So you can also type this into Amazon. We have tried putting the girls on leashes. They do not like it. So this was our compromise. One way we help them get used to it is it's out all the time by the door. Sometimes I throw treats in there and they go in there and hang out and go to sleep. Another way we got them used to this was by taking them on shorter walks, like around the block a couple times. They do not switch spots. Someone asked me, Dudu is on top. Baby cat is in the bottom bunk because she prefers it. She does not like being up high. They have little pockets. You can unzip from the front and the back, and you can also detach them and carry them as carriers.

You'll be getting rid of the toxins from sweat, urine, stool, and you want to make sure these continue to happen outward and do not recirculate back into you. Side note, take your binder before the sauna and away from your medications. Number three, take a shower right after you finish your sauna.

It's SPF skincare that you can wear alone or double as a base for your makeup. It locks in hydration with a light, subtle finish and it's amazing for sensitive skin. That's why I'm using it as the base for today's easy beach day look. I'm following up with the Revealer Skin Improving Foundation which has a nice natural finish and also has SPF. The Glow Ivy Vitamin Infused Skin Enhancer just adds that extra summer glow. Super easy to use and just wait until that sun hits you. As for the lips, I'm using Kosas Wet Lip Oil, a hydrating magical gloss you could probably see shining from a mile away. And for the final touch, the Airbrow Volumizing Gel conditions and adds a bit of depth to my brows without doing too much. This final beach day look is definitely my vibe. I love how natural the finish is. And it lasted pretty much all day even after the beach day shenanigans. Did I mention Dreambeam is also water resistant? Coming from someone who used to never wear sunscreen, I cannot wait to reapply this. Shop Dreambeam now to feel the magic.

Reason number one, dynamic textural contrast. The creaminess of the jalapeno sauce, the meltiness of the cheese, and the fluffiness of the eggs all gets perfectly contrasted by the crispiness of the hash brown patty. Number two, manual ergonomics. You can see here the crunch wrap fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and has edge handles for extra dexterity. That leaves your offhand available for maximum Cinnabon Delights coffee juggage. Number three, tortilla duality. You get the crisp, the crunch, the Maillard browning off the first bite, but then the texture yields to the subtle pleasant chewiness that is signature for flour tortillas. Number four, universal sauce ability. The unique hexagonal shape allows for every single bite to create the perfect breakfast salsa pocket, increasing the breakfast crunch wrap's total sauce holding coefficient, or SHC as it's commonly known. Number five, bacon. Now the best part of this feature is bacon. Furthermore, bacon. And I think if we really break it down, bacon. And that's why Taco Bell is my number one breakfast buy. So get to Taco Bell before 11 a.m. so you can try one of their delicious crunch wraps and level up your breakfast.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2,"[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

There are many causes of pigmentation including age spots, melasma, acne marks, UV damage, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. It particularly affects people with darker skin tones due to a higher content of melanin, the pigment that determines our skin tone. Hyperpigmentation occurs when there's excessive transfer of pigment from our melanocytes to the skin surface. To stop this process, you need a powerful tyrosinase inhibitor. Antithiamidol developed by Eucerin after 10 years of research and the most powerful tyrosinase inhibitor found of over 50,000 tested. Over 1,000 people tested the products in clinical trials with first results visible in two weeks and continued improvement with regular combined use. When using the day cream, serum, and night cream together as part of your regular routine, they can reduce pigmentation by up to 93%. Finally, an accessible science-backed solution to hyperpigmentation.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",1,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

You can find me at Josh's Baking, and I am so excited to be joining the Betty Crocker makers. I've been baking for almost five years now. I wanna say my first memory in the kitchen is probably sitting at the kitchen counter watching my mom pipe buttercream over some elaborate wedding cakes she was working on at the time. I wanna say my first introduction to Betty Crocker was probably angel food cake. That felt like a staple cake mix in our house growing up. When I think about Betty Crocker, I'd say the first thing that comes to mind is dependable. You know that what you see is what you're gonna get, that this recipe on this box is gonna work. A kitchen gadget I recommend everyone gets is a food scale, hands down. It's more accurate, you can bake any recipe in the world at that point, and it's surprisingly super horrible. The most unexpected ingredient I like to incorporate into baking is probably cardamom. It's arguably my favorite spice right now, especially when paired with chocolate. That's a drink to you. Dessert that takes me back to childhood would have to be peanut butter cookies. For some reason as a kid, making that little crosshatch with the fork was like, wow, I'm a baker, and they're delicious, come on.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",5,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
